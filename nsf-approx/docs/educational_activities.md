# Educational Activities

## Student Training and Development

This project provides training and professional development opportunities for postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research areas. Although our work is fundamentally collaborative in nature, our postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduate students each lead specific efforts in support of our overall goals.

### Postdoctoral and Graduate Student Training

- **Rana Shahout** and **Weifan Jiang** worked on improving scheduling algorithms for LLMs, developing the TRAIL system for embedding-based scheduling
- **Yang Zhou** worked on CPU offloading for online LLM inference, contributing to the NEO system

### Undergraduate Research Opportunities

The project provides research opportunities for undergraduate students through:
- Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) funding
- Course project opportunities in networking and algorithms classes

## Teaching Impact

This project provides more course project choices in Harvard networking classes. As an example, Michael Mitzenmacher teaches a graduate-level class on algorithms focused on networking applications. While students have a free choice of projects, potential projects based on our research agenda are suggested to students. This class is open to undergraduates, who typically make up around 50% of the students in the course.

## Outreach Activities

The PIs have invested in outreach activities to increase interactions with major stakeholders, broaden the impact of our work, and deepen the educational benefits of this research:

- **Keynotes and Invited Talks**: PIs have delivered keynotes at major conferences (LANMAN, ICCCN, SIGCOMM workshops) and given talks at industry partners (Cisco, Meta)
- **Tutorials**: Co-authored and delivered tutorials at SIGMETRICS on using predictions for scheduling and scheduling with LLM systems
- **Panel Participation**: Participated in panels at SIGCOMM workshop on Next-Generation Network Observability (NGNO) and Women in Data Science (WiDS) Cambridge Panel on Sustainable Computing: Systems and AI
- **Service**: PI Yu continues to serve on the steering committee for NSDI and AP-Net

## Research Dissemination

Research findings have been widely shared through:
- Peer-reviewed publications in top-tier venues (ICLR, MLSys, NeurIPS, HotNets)
- Invited talks and keynotes at major conferences and institutions
- Tutorials and workshops
- Open-source code releases (NEO system)
